## Synopsis
A simple bash script that automatically backs up commonly used files to an external storage device as well as .vimrc and .bash_profile.
It does this by creating a Tar GZip file that is named after the current date within the device.

## Installation
Once downloaded, go into the code and change the DIRECTORY variable to the name of your external storage device
